# Thanks for using Connection Guard, the free connection security plugin with premium quality.
# There is a lot to configure, if you want to. If not, you don't have to!
# If you leave it as default, Connection Guard will use ProxyCheck (https://proxycheck.io/)
# to check for vpn or proxy usage and block connections from those. For geo data, Connection Guard
# will use the IP-API (https://ip-api.com/) service.

# Message config used for all messages send to the player.
# You can add your own languages by creating a file called <language>.yml and setting the
# entry below to the file name without the .yml extension.

  cache:
    # The cache is very important to effectively use the requests you have and avoid running into the request limit.
    # Once a request to a service is made, its data is stored for the specified duration (see below) and used instead of
    # making a new request. This data does not change very frequently and you can cache the results for days, if you want to.
    # If you want to clear the cache, you can do that by typing in the command /connectionguard clearcache, which is especially
    # necessary when you add or remove countries to the geo-block-list.
    # Available types:
    # - SQLite (no further configuration is necessary, stored in a file in the plugins directory)
    # - Redis (configure connection details below, useful when deploying Connection Guard on multiple servers)
    # - Disabled (disable any caching, make absolutely sure that you don't run into request limits!)
